title: About me

I am Qiaohan Chu, which is my Chinese name. I also have an English name called Johannah Chu, which is selected by myself, after reading some materials from Baidu and Zhihu. I wanted an English name because I used to be an intern in a company where the people like to communicate in English.

I used to be an undergraduate in East China University of Science and Technology, School of Mathematics. Now, I am a PhD candidate in East China Normal University, Software Engineering Institute. My primary research interest lies in cryptography.

I have been trained in Latin dance, playing the flute, and playing cucurbit flute under the guidance of unprofessional teachers (thus my performances are below "unprofessional"). I have also been trained in playing the violin, but I think my performance is almost like the performance of people who haven't been trained. I don't regard any of the above as my hobby, but if someone would like to talk about them, I am willing to be involved, as an amateur \^_\^.

Please feel free to contact me, if you can discover my contact information and you are interested in me \^_\^.
